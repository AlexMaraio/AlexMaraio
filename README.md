# Hi there, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

Third year PhD student at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh
probing the fundamental physics of the Universe through the study of weak
gravitational lensing ðŸ”­

I have extensive experience in writing scientific codes using both Python and
C++, feel free to have a browse of my repositories. Also have a small amount of
experience in web development using the Flask backend and using SQL databases. 

Currently looking for an internship in software development and/or data analysis
using machine learning methods, feel free to drop me an email if you like what
you see!
