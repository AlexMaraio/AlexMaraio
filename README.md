# Hi there, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD-trained data scientist and programmer. I probed the fundamental physics
of our Universe at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh
through the study of weak gravitational lensing ðŸ”­

I have extensive experience in writing scientific codes using both Python and
C++, feel free to have a browse of my repositories. Also have a small amount of
experience in web development using the Flask backend and using SQL databases. 

Currently looking for full-time employment in software development and/or data science
using machine learning methods, feel free to drop me an email at maraio@roe.ac.uk
if you like what you see!
